# Overview
Austin Campbell <br><br>
As a software engineer focused on furthering my skills, I created this Kotlin-based automotive conversion application to deepen my understanding of the language and its features. The software is designed to handle various unit conversions related to automotive metrics such as torque, pressure, gear ratios, temperature, and socket sizes. This project allowed me to explore Kotlinâ€™s syntax, handling user inputs, and structuring a CLI application.

The purpose of writing this software was to develop a tool that can perform precise automotive measurements and conversions while practicing core concepts of Kotlin, such as functions, conditionals, and loops.
I have never utilized Kotlin before, and I originally attempted to make an application that could be accessed on my phone while at work.

# Development Environment

The development of this software was done using the following tools:

- IDE: IntelliJ IDEA
- Programming Language: Kotlin
- Libraries: None (pure Kotlin application)

I used Kotlin to build the CLI-based application, focusing on its concise syntax and efficient handling of conversions. The software allows for interactive use, where users can input values to convert between various units.

# Useful Websites

Useful websites to me:

- [Kotlin Documentation](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/home.html)
- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)
- [JetBrains Kotlin](https://blog.jetbrains.com/kotlin/)

# Future Work

There are several areas where I plan to improve and add functionality to the software:

- Implement application into a web app to utilize on mobile.
- Add error handling for edge cases in conversions.
- Include more complex automotive-related conversions (e.g., fuel economy, engine performance).
- Implement unit tests to ensure the accuracy of conversion functions.
- Improve user interface/UX for smoother interaction in the CLI.
